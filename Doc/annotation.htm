<p class="Justify">The annotation process starts by selecting a sentence to be
annotated from the displayed text in the lower panel.
</p>
<p class="Justify">Text can be entered directly in the tab named <span
class="command">Scratch</span>: a sentence can be selected from this tab by
dragging the mouse while pressing the left button. Once a fragment of text
(sentence) is selected, the tool bar button <img src="Annotate.gif" width="16"
height="16"> is enabled. Pressing this button, the selected text is submitted
to the POS tagger for tagging and then it is displayed in the annotation
panel.
</p>
<p class="Justify">
Sentences loaded from corpus files can just be selected with a mouse click.
</p>

<h3>POS Tagging</h3>

<p class="Justify">Select the POS tag for a word from the line below the
sentence: the list of available POS tags for the given corpus will appear in
the pane to the left; select (left mouse button) the appropriate one to
annotate the word.

<p align="center"><img src="PosTag.jpg"></p>

<h3>Dependency Tagging</h3>

<p class="Justify">In order to create a dependency relation between two words,
first select (left mouse button) the <i>dependent</i> word (the one from
where the arc starts). This word gets marked in blue.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="a4.jpg"></p>

<p class="Justify">
Next, click on the <i>head</i> word: an arc from the dependent word to the head
word will be created. This arc will be labeled with an empty label "[  ]".</p>

<p align="center"><img src="a5.jpg"></p>

<p class="Justify">
In order to assign a dependency relation to an arc one must select its label
and then click on the appropriate label in the left panel.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="a7.jpg"></p>

<p class="Justify">
A dependency relation can be deleted by selecting its arc label and pressing
the <i>Delete</i> key.</p>

<p class="Justify">
According to the <a href="biblio.htm">dependency grammar</a> formalism, each
token in a sentence (word or punctuation) must depend on a single other
one. The only exception is the head of the whole sentence (usually the main
verb), which depends on no other word. This fact is graphically indicated by a
dangling arc like the one attached to the verb <tt>likes</tt> in the following
figure:

<p align="center"><img src="Ann1.jpg"></p>

<p class="Justify">Specifying that a word is the head of a sentence is
achieved as follows: click on the head word to mark it, then click on the word
itself for indicating it as head of the sentence. Assigning a type to this new
arc (typically <tt>ROOT</tt>) is performed like for others relation types.</p>

<p class="Justify">Since a sentence can have just one head word, <b>DGA</b>
allows defining only one such word. Once a head word for a sentence has been
identified, no other word can be marked as head word.</p>

<p class="Justify">The actions for creating and labeling dependency relations
can be performed repeatedly until the user considers the sentence to be
properly and completely annotated.</p>

<p class="Justify">An annotated sentence can be saved by using the menu
command <span class="command">Append To..</span>, which lets the user choose a file to which the
sentence will be added.</p>

<p class="Justify">If another sentence is selected for being annotated
witthout having being saved, the user is notified and is allowed to save the
sentence, even if it is not completely annotated.</p>

<h3>Undo/Redo</h3>

The buttons <img src="undo.png" width="16" height="16"> and <img
src="redo.png" width="16" height="16"> can used to undo previous editing
actions or redo them.

<h3>Pan/Zoom</h3>

The buttons <img src="pan.gif" width="16" height="16"> and <img
src="zoom.gif" width="16" height="16"> can used to pan or zoom the image of
the sentence.
